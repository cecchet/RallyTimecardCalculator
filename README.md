# Rally Timecard Calculator
A stage rally timecard calculator for Android devices

Check the Frog Racing website at https://www.frogracing.us/the-shop/rally-time-cards for more details and a tutorial on timecards.

The app should work on most Android devices (even old ones). Just download https://github.com/cecchet/RallyTimecardCalculator/blob/main/rally-timecard-calculator-1.0b.apk and install it on your device. As the app is currently not ditributed through the Play Store, you will have to authorize installation of apps from unknown sources (see https://www.applivery.com/docs/troubleshooting/android-unknown-sources/ for some help on that).

Screen resolution might be an issue on some device, if some portions of the screen are truncated, try the other version of the app with a more compact layout: https://github.com/cecchet/RallyTimecardCalculator/blob/main/rally-timecard-calculator-1.0b-small-screen.apk. 

If you have an issue, send a screenshot and model of your device by email to manu at frogracing dot us.
